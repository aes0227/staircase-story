<h1>The Story of the Staircases</h1>
<h2>Behind the scenes of the vibrant staircases that have brought communities together in San Francisco through art.</h2>

When artist Colette Crutcher submitted her proposal to mosaic a staircase, she never imagined her artwork would become one of San Francisco’s hidden gems. 

The Moraga Steps in San Francisco’s Sunset district feature a tiled, ocean-themed, spiral design down its 163 steps. 
Since its creation in 2005, the staircase has been a main attraction in the neighborhood, drawing in plenty of San Franciscans and tourists alike.

As one of the first mosaic staircases in San Francisco, it’s an example of bringing new life into staircases, a core feature of the city due to its many hills and slopes. 

Since the creation of the Moraga Steps, more and more staircases have become public artworks, bridging communities together and beautifying neighborhoods. </p>

<h3>Commision process</h3>

<p class = "body">

However, the process of decorating staircases and other public spaces commences with a lengthy commissioning process.
<br>
<br>

According to the San Francisco Arts Commission, the city must approve the temporary or permanent installation of art on any city property. 
San Francisco also allocates a small amount of funding to public art and welcomes artists to submit proposals to receive funding. 
From there, three artists are selected as finalists by a committee to execute their ideas before one is ultimately chosen. 
<br>
<br>

Some artists, such as Crutcher and artist collaborator Aileen Barr, try to fundraise from the community for their projects as opposed to waiting for funding from the city. 
Artists bring these projects into reality by turning to donors in their communities who have their name featured in the piece in return.
<br>
<br>

Although public art projects are generally not well-funded and take a long time to come to fruition, Crutcher and Barr are lucky enough to become well-known for their mosaic work on staircases so that people reach out to them for independent projects. This is preferable to them because they’re more artistically liberated to execute the piece according to their own style. 

</p>

<h3>Artistic process </h3>

<p class = "body">
A single public artwork installation goes through many stages that many fail to acknowledge. It takes artists Crutcher and Barr years to transform a blank piece of paper into a life-sized public artwork. 
The Moraga Steps took more than a year to complete. The duo who were brought together through that project had a lot to learn from each other and the community. 
<br>
<br>

In the initial phase of the project proposal, Crutcher and Barr individually supplied draft designs to the commissioners. 
The organizers liked both of these artists' designs and styles and asked them if they wanted to collaborate on this project, which led to their success. 
<br>
<br>

However, not every project is like this; sometimes "you end up doing a lot of work in creating a concept and a design," and it is not guaranteed that it will be chosen, according to Barr.
<br>
<br>

“It's a hard process as you're shortlisted with a couple other artists,” she said. Depending on the project type, artists of all mediums have a chance to propose a design.
<br>
<br>

According to Crutcher, the most difficult aspect of designing a mosaic staircase is perspective. A staircase width can be as narrow as 6 feet or as wide as 30 feet, depending on the location. 
Similarly, the staircase could be either long or short.
<br>
<br>

“It is a challenge to design a staircase, especially these staircases when they’re narrow and really long. Coming up with a design that suits that, and [how]
 your design has to be cut up into strips. And it moves back in space,” Barr said.
 <br>
 <br>

Once the final design is selected, a life-sized sketch is created to assist the artists in the next steps. Crutcher recalled how she and Barr viewed the design in her basement studio from a 
floor above to see the entire piece as they were creating(working on?) the tiles for Moraga Steps. 
<br>
<br>

“We did have to draw it actual size with a big roll of paper. We were doing it [in my studio] where there wasn’t enough rooms. So we roll it out on the floor and then draw a little bit
 and then one of us would climb up the stairs and look down,” she said.
<br>
<br>

In the next steps, the artists work hands on with ceramics and/or tiles. Barr considers this part her favorite in the entire process. 
<br>
<br>

“Once I have my design done and I know what I am doing and I start making stuff, that’s the part I like, when I get my hands get dirty,” she said. 
<br>
<br>
Throughout their first project together, Barr taught Crutcher the ins and outs of ceramic tile making, from rolling out the clay to shaping it into design pieces.
<br>
<br>

The glazing of the tiles follows, and Barr has a large collection to choose from as well as plenty of test pieces to show her clients. Glazing the tiles and allowing them to dry 
before putting them in the kiln is a critical step in the process. Barr's studio space has a ready-to-use kiln that can hold a large number of tiles at once. When Barr and Crutcher 
collaborate on a project, the ceramic work is usually done in Barr's studio.
<br>
<br>

The artists' final step is to lay out and glue all of the tiles on a plastic mesh for installation, which is done by a company. While the art is being installed, the artists will go
 to supervise and assist with placement, as well as if something happens to a tile.
 <br>
 <br>

Though the process might be lengthy, the artists find satisfaction in being able to show their work in a meaningful way. 
<br>
<br>

“Public art does pay something at least so it's a way to make a living and to get your artwork seen by people, which is exciting. Makes you feel like you're part of a
 community which is what's been seen by,” Crutcher said.
<br>

</p>

<h3>Community impact</h3>

<p class = "body">
Even after a staircase is installed, the upward climb continues. One of the intriguing parts about public work like staircases is the role the people play in the art 
itself. The staircases designed by Barr, Crutcher, and other artists have left immeasurable impacts on the community. 
<br>
<br>

One of these impacts has been bringing people together across San Francisco. Alexandra Kenin, a hiking enthusiast and San Francisco resident who documented over 900 staircases around
 the city, said “occasionally, you’ll meet someone really cool on a stairway.”  She said she met a man in his 90s named Rudy who encouraged her to keep climbing up the steep staircase.

<br>
<br>
While some staircases are commissioned by the city, others, like the famous Lincoln Park Steps, were funded entirely by the community. According to Barr, who designed the 
Lincoln Park Steps, the staircase, built in the early 1900s, was falling apart and being graffitied over, so this project was an opportunity to make the city look nice again.
<br>
<br>
Other staircases improve the aesthetic of certain San Francisco neighborhoods in different ways. According to Crutcher, the Moraga Steps were inspired by a woman who moved to a 
particularly gray and foggy part of San Francisco after living in Rio. Missing all the colorfulness of Rio, she began organizing a project to decorate the steps. Barr and Crutcher 
worked together to design mosaic tiles and the steps became a huge tourist attraction and a brightening addition to the area.
<br>
<br>
The Hidden Garden staircase, which is just a few blocks from the 16th Avenue and Moraga staircase, also brightened up a dark area. Barr said because the staircase was dark and hidden, 
“people didn’t want to use it in the evening coming off the train…so they wanted to create something much brighter and more inviting.”
<br>
<br>

Staircases around San Francisco have brightened the city, but it is also the community’s responsibility to participate in the upkeep of these works of art. Paul Signorelli, one of the
 key leaders of the Hidden Garden staircase project, believes the community is the center of public art projects. 
 
<br>
<br>
“It’s building communities that suddenly have the opportunity to bring two disparate neighborhoods together.”
